# Technical Interview for React Juniors and Trainees in Live Coding

**Goal**: Retrieve a random cat fact from [Facts Random API](https://catfact.ninja/fact) and render the image based on the first word of that fact fetched from [Image Random API](https://cataas.com/cat/says/hello).

**Limitations**: Create the project without initiating from a React template, and configuring the React applcation from a Vanilla JavaScript template instead.

**Steps**:

1. Create a React app from a Vanilla JavaScript template.
2. Fetch the data from both API using useEffect.
3. Create a custom hooks for each API to fetch.
4. Perform a E2E test with Playwright.
